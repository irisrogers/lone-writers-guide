How to swim in the deep water - A lone writer’s guide to survival
=================================================================

Starting notes:
---------------

* Why should documentation be tested?  How is this different than a content review?
* Who should test it?
* How to implement a procedure where SMEs (developers, support) test the procedures/info in the docs?

## Why test docs?
The real test of a doc is to follow the doc, step by step, to do an installation or various functions of the product. Be very careful to assume that the product's eventual user does not know even the most basic things that you already know about the product. If the doc does not say, "Do X", then don't do it during the testing.

* Any documented procedure for using a new product is useless if one key step or multiple steps are missing.
* Product bugs pop up during doc testing. Find out how to file a bug in your developement environment.
* 

## Who should test the doc?
* The doc writer. Developers and quality assurance people know the product well enough that they automatically fill in missing steps. "Well, everybody knows you need to do xyz at this point."
* An intelligent person who is outside of the engineering part of the company.
