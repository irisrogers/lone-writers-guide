Starting notes:
---------------

* Create a Technical Product Summary.If one does not exist. Check with Marketing / Sales.
* Create a *concise* technical summary that identifies key terms, key components, and key concepts. 
* The language can be "marketing-friendly" but the target audience is the technical readership in a prospect or customer organization. 
* The summary provides both external and internal readers with a "road map" of the product's architecture and high-level operational features.
