How to swim in the deep water - A lone writerâ€™s guide to survival
=================================================================

Starting notes:
---------------

* What docs are you writing? Customer-facing docs, internal docs, marketing docs? How not to get trapped into doing it ALL.
* Set up deadlines / timelines for getting draft content created, reviewed, published.
* Avoiding burnout and suckerville.  Tips for setting expectations with self and management (priorities, headcount, budget, schedule, ...). Many startups take full advantage of a hard working "one person band" slaving in a sweatshop.

Hack-a-thon content:
--------------------
As the lone technical writer at your company, first determine the docs that you are tasked with writing.
Sometimes, the job specification and description duties do not align with what you are tasked to write at your company.
Early on, be sure to obtain (more than likely create) a list of all documentation that you are creating/reviewing/publishing.
Next, identify your documentation by audience and the department.

Identify documentation:
By audience (external vs internal)
By department (Support, Implementations, Marketing, Developers, etc)

Documentation Examples:
Release notes
Changelogs
Product Documentation
User Manuals
How-tos
Quick-start Guides
White papers
Slide decks

Determine who your SMEs and stakeholders are for your docs.

Deadlines and timelines
Work backwards from due dates. Most external documentation deadlines are tied to customer/client contracts (service-level agreements). For example, release notes are contractually required to be sent to clients one week before a release.
Set deadlines for documentation draft material from SMEs, review sessions, and final reviews. Effective collaboration and communication, especially when SMEs are in different offices or remote, is essential for meeting deadlines.

Avoiding burnout and suckerville
Learn to say NO! (with tact, of course ;) )
Set realistic expectations for a lone writer workload.
